# hello-world
Hi there Humans, I am getting back into programming.  My first real foray was learning QBASIC, which I may return to because it has excellent array functionality, and the files are super compressible.  I also used to manually code tone transitions in SBAGEN, and hopefully I can integrate all of that with MATLAB and make some interesting things.
